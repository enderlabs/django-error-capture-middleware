``````
Extra Required Libraries:

 * PyYAML


Required Settings
=================

 * ERROR_CAPTURE_HANDLERS: Tuple listing all handler packages to execute. The last
   package is expected to return information back to the user!
 * ERROR_CAPTURE_ENABLE_MULTPROCESS: Turns on multiprocessing. This will speed up
   the time between and error and when the user sees it, but can return faster
   than the bug system can return.
