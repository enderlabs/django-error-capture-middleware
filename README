Extra Required Libraries:

Required Settings
=================

 * ERROR_CAPTURE_HANDLERS: Tuple listing all handler packages to execute. The last
   package is expected to return information back to the user!

   the time between and error and when the user sees it, but can return faster
   than the bug system can return.

   handlers when DEBUG=True
